= Overriding the Built-in Serializers
:description: Hazelcast serializes basic data types such as `Byte` and `Boolean` using a built-in serializer. If you would prefer to implement your own serializer for these data types, you can override the built-in serializer.

{description}

For a complete list of data types that use the built-in serializer, see xref:serialization.adoc#data-types-with-built-in-serialization[].

WARNING: You should use this configuration cautiously. Built-in serializers are used heavily by the Hazelcast internally.  If any of the instances in a cluster overrides a built-in serializer, all the members and clients in that cluster must override it with the same serializer.

This configuration is specifically for the following cases:

- You implement a a custom serialization configuration by the user for a type
- Hazelcast adds a built-in serializer for the same type in a future release.

To be able to support rolling upgrade from an old version, you need to make sure of
the backward compatibility of the serialization. As a solution, you can set this property on
the new version so that the new instances can override the new built-in serializers with their
existing custom ones.

By default, you cannot override the built-in serializers. To enable this feature, configure your Hazelcast members with the following:
