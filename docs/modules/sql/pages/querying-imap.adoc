= Querying IMap

The following subsections describe how you can access Hazelcast map objects
and perform queries on them.

== Names

The SQL service exposes `IMap` objects as tables in the predefined `partitioned`
schema using exact names. This schema is in the SQL service search path so that
you can access the `IMap` objects with or without the schema name.

Schema and table names are case-sensitive; you can access the `employee` map, for example,
as `employee` or `partitioned.employee`, but not as `Employee`:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM employee
SELECT * FROM partitioned.employee
----

== Fields

The SQL service resolves fields accessible from the SQL automatically. The
service reads the first local entry pair of the `IMap` to construct the
list of fields. If the `IMap` does not have local entries on the member where
the query is started, then the list of fields cannot be resolved, and an
exception is thrown.

Field names are case-sensitive.

=== Key and Value Objects

An `IMap` entry consists of a key and a value. These are accessible
through the `__key` and `this` aliases. The following query returns
the keys and values of all entries in a map:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT __key, this FROM employee
----

=== Key and Value Fields

You may also access the nested fields of a key or a value. The list of exposed
fields depends on the serialization format, as described below:

* For Java objects (xref:serialization:implementing-java-serializable.adoc[`Serializable`], xref:serialization:implementing-dataserializable.adoc[`DataSerializable`], xref:serialization:implementing-java-serializable.adoc#identifieddataserializable[`IdentifiedDataSerializable`]),
the object is deserialized if needed and then analyzed using the reflection mechanism. Only public
fields and getters are taken into account. A public field is exposed using its exact name.
A getter is exposed using the JavaBean naming conventions, i.e, getter method names are composed of the
 word get plus the property name with the first character of each word capitalized.
* For xref:serialization:implementing-portable-serialization.adoc[`Portable`] objects, the fields that are written in the `Portable.writePortable`
method are exposed using their exact names.

NOTE: You cannot query JSON fields in SQL. If you want to query JSON, see xref:query:how-distributed-query-works.adoc#querying-json-strings[Querying JSON Strings].

Consider the `Employee` class from the example above; the SQL service can access
the following fields:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| Name
| Type

|`name`
|`VARCHAR`

|`age`
|`INTEGER`
|===

Together with the key and value objects, you may query the following fields from
`IMap<Long, Employee>`:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT __key, this, name, age FROM employee
----

If both the key and value have fields with the same name, then the field of the
value is exposed.

=== "SELECT *" Queries

You may use the `SELECT * FROM <table>` syntax to get all the table fields.

The `__key` and `this` fields are returned by the `SELECT *` queries if they do not
have nested fields. For `IMap<Long, Employee>`, the following query does
not return the `this` field, because the value has nested fields `name` and `age`:

[source,sql]
----
-- Returns __key, name, age
SELECT * FROM employee
----

== Indexes

The SQL service can use `IMap` indexes to speed up the execution of certain queries.
`SORTED` and `HASH` indexes are supported.

See the xref:query:how-distributed-query-works.adoc#indexing-queries[Indexing Queries section] for more information on `IMap`
index creation.

== High-Density Memory Store

You can query the `IMap` objects with `InMemoryFormat.NATIVE` if they have
at least one index.

See xref:configuration:configuring-with-system-properties.adoc[Configuring with System Properties] for
more information on setting system properties.
