= Querying Maps with SQL

The following subsections describe how you can access Hazelcast map objects
and perform queries on them.

== Accessing Maps by Name

The SQL service exposes map objects as tables in the predefined `partitioned`
schema using exact names. This schema is in the SQL service search path so that
you can access the map objects with or without the schema name.

Schema and table names are case-sensitive. For example, you can access the `employee` map
as `employee` or `partitioned.employee`, but not as `Employee`:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM employee
SELECT * FROM partitioned.employee
----

== Querying Map Entries

A map entry consists of a key and a value. To query the key, you must use the `__key` alias. To query a value, you can use the `this` alias.

For example, the following query returns the keys and values of all entries in a map called `employee`:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT __key, this FROM employee
----

To allow you to query map entries, the SQL
service reads a map's first local entry pair to construct its
list of fields. If the map does not have local entries on the member where
the query is started, then the list of fields cannot be resolved, and an
exception is thrown.

NOTE: Field names are case-sensitive.

=== Querying Nested Key and Value Fields

If a map entry contains nested fields in its keys or values, you may be able to query them, depending on how those entries are serialized:

* For Java objects (xref:serialization:implementing-java-serializable.adoc[`Serializable`], xref:serialization:implementing-dataserializable.adoc[`DataSerializable`], xref:serialization:implementing-java-serializable.adoc#identifieddataserializable[`IdentifiedDataSerializable`]), you may query only public
fields and getter methods. To query public fields, use their exact name, and to query getter methods, use the JavaBean naming conventions.

* For xref:serialization:implementing-portable-serialization.adoc[`Portable`] objects, the fields that are written in the `Portable.writePortable()`
method are exposed using their exact names.

NOTE: You cannot query JSON fields in SQL. If you want to query JSON, see xref:query:how-distributed-query-works.adoc#querying-json-strings[Querying JSON Strings].

For example, in this `Employee` object, the SQL service has access
to the following fields:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| Name
| Type

|`name`
|`VARCHAR`

|`age`
|`INTEGER`
|===

If you create a map whose values are `Employee` objects, you can query the following fields from it:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT __key, this, name, age FROM employee
----

NOTE: If both the key and the value share a field with the same name, you may only query the value's field and not the key's field.

=== Using Parameterized Queries

A parameterized query is a type of SQL query that requires at least one parameter for execution. Instead of putting data straight into an SQL statement, parameterized queries allow you to use the `?` placeholder. This type of query is often used to mitigate SQL injection attacks. For a discussion on this topic, see this answer on link:https://stackoverflow.com/a/33033576[StackOverflow^].

For example, consider the following example of an `Employee` object.

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| Name
| Type

|`name`
|`VARCHAR`

|`age`
|`INTEGER`

|`paycheckInfo`
|`PayCheckInfo`
|===

You could create a parameterized query that finds employees who are older than a given integer:

[source,java]
----
int ageToCompare = 30;
sql.execute("SELECT name FROM employee WHERE employee.age > ?", ageToCompare);
----

In this `Employee` object, the last value is an instance of a `PayCheckInfo` class. Here is the structure of that class:


[cols="1,1"]
|===
| Name
| Type

|`startDate`
|`INTEGER`

|`amount`
|`INTEGER`
|===

Whether you can query nested fields in this object depends on how your map entries are serialized:

- For Java objects (xref:serialization:implementing-java-serializable.adoc[`Serializable`], xref:serialization:implementing-dataserializable.adoc[`DataSerializable`], xref:serialization:implementing-java-serializable.adoc#identifieddataserializable[`IdentifiedDataSerializable`]), you must xref:clusters:deploying-code-on-member.adoc[add the object's class to the classpath of the member] you are sending the query to.

- For xref:serialization:implementing-portable-serialization.adoc[`Portable`] objects, you do not need to add the object's class to the classpath of the member, unless you want to use parameterized queries to compare one object against another.

For example, with `Portable` objects, you could run the following queries without adding the `PayCheckInfo` class to the member's classpath:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT paycheckInfo FROM employee WHERE employee.age > 10
SELECT paycheckInfo FROM employee WHERE employee.paycheckInfo.amount > 1000
----

But, to use parameterized queries to compare one `payCheckInfo` object to another, you must add the `payCheckInfo` class to the member. Doing so allows the member to convert the parameter to a `payCheckInfo` object.

[source,java]
----
PayCheckInfo payCheckInfo = new PayCheckInfo(10102021, 1212);
sql.execute("SELECT name FROM employee WHERE employee.paycheckInfo > ?", payCheckInfo);
----

=== "SELECT *" Queries

You may use the `SELECT * FROM <table>` syntax to get all the table fields.

The `__key` and `this` fields are returned by the `SELECT *` queries if they do not
have nested fields. For `IMap<Long, Employee>`, the following query does
not return the `this` field, because the value has nested fields `name` and `age`:

[source,sql]
----
-- Returns __key, name, age
SELECT * FROM employee
----

== Indexes

The SQL service can use map indexes to speed up the execution of certain queries.
`SORTED` and `HASH` indexes are supported.

See the xref:query:how-distributed-query-works.adoc#indexing-queries[Indexing Queries section] for more information creating indexes for maps.

[NOTE]
====
To query map objects that are stored in xref:data-structures:map.adoc#setting-in-memory-format[`NATIVE` in-memory format], those objects must have
at least one index.

See xref:configuration:configuring-with-system-properties.adoc[Configuring with System Properties] for
more information on setting system properties.
