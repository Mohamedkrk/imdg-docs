= WanBatchReplication Implementation

Hazelcast offers `WanBatchReplication` implementation for the WAN replication.

As you see in the above configuration examples, this implementation is configured using the `class-name` element (in the declarative configuration) or the method `setClassName` (in the programmatic configuration).

The implementation `WanBatchReplication` waits until:

* a pre-defined number of replication events are generated, (see the xref:batch-size.adoc[Batch Size section])
* or a pre-defined amount of time is passed (see the xref:batch-maximum-delay.adoc[Batch Maximum Delay section]).

NOTE: `WanNoDelayReplication` implementation has been removed. You can still achieve this behavior by setting the batch size to `1` while configuring your WAN replication.
